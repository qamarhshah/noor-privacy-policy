      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: February 28, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Developer: Qamar Shah</p>
    </header>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>Noor is built on a simple principle: your data is yours. The app does not require an account, does not collect personal information, and does not sell or share any data with third parties for advertising or profiling purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Qamar Shah ("Developer", "we", "us") handles information in connection with the Noor — Islamic Prayer and Quran mobile application ("App"), available on iOS. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy is written to be clear and straightforward — not to obscure what we do, but to make it genuinely easy to understand.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Noor does not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, or any personally identifiable information</li>
      <li>User accounts or login credentials of any kind</li>
      <li>Usage analytics, crash reports sent to our own servers, or behavioral tracking</li>
      <li>Device identifiers for advertising purposes</li>
      <li>Location history, movement patterns, or any GPS data beyond what is described in Section 3</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
    <p>Noor requests access to your device's GPS location for the sole purpose of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculating accurate daily prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) based on your current coordinates</li>
      <li>Determining the Qibla direction (the direction of the Kaaba in Makkah)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your location is processed entirely on-device using standard astronomical calculations. It is <strong>never transmitted to our servers</strong>, never stored beyond the current session, and never shared with any third party. If you deny location permission, the App allows you to manually select a city from a preset list.</p>

    <h2>4. Notification Permissions</h2>
    <p>Noor may request permission to send local notifications. These notifications are used exclusively to deliver adhan (prayer call) alerts at your scheduled prayer times. All notifications are generated locally on your device — no notification data is sent to or routed through our servers. You may disable notifications at any time through your device's system settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Downloaded Content</h2>
    <p>If you choose to download Quran audio recitations for offline playback, those audio files are stored locally on your device only. They are not uploaded, synced, or transmitted anywhere. You may delete downloaded content at any time from within the App's Settings screen.</p>

    <h2>6. Subscription and Purchases</h2>
    <p>Noor offers optional premium features through an in-app subscription. All purchase transactions are processed by Apple through the App Store. The Developer does not receive or store your payment card information. Subscription management (including cancellation) is handled through your Apple ID account settings.</p>
    <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscription entitlements. RevenueCat may receive a pseudonymous device identifier and purchase receipt data for the purpose of verifying subscription status. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or payment details. You can review RevenueCat's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">Noor integrates with a small number of third-party services to deliver its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Expo (Expo Application Services)</strong> — The App is built using the Expo framework. Expo may process technical metadata (such as device OS version) during the build and update delivery process. See <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expo.dev/privacy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>QuranCDN / QuranicAudio</strong> — When streaming or downloading Quran audio, requests are made to QuranCDN's content delivery network. These requests contain standard HTTP metadata (IP address, device type) as is typical for any web request, but no personal information is sent by the App beyond what your device's network stack includes automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Used for subscription entitlement verification, as described in Section 6 above.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not integrate any advertising networks, social media SDKs, or marketing analytics tools.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because Noor does not collect personal data on our servers, there is no user data for us to retain or delete. All App preferences (prayer calculation method, theme, downloaded audio files, bookmarks) are stored locally on your device using your device's standard storage mechanisms. Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Noor is suitable for users of all ages, including children. The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from any user, including children under the age of 13. No account creation is required, no personal data is transmitted, and no behavioral tracking is performed. The App fully complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since Noor does not transmit or store personal data on our servers, the primary security surface is your own device. We encourage you to use standard device security practices such as a screen lock and keeping your operating system up to date. Any data stored locally on your device is subject to your device's built-in security protections.</p>

    <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete it. Because Noor does not collect or store personal data on our servers, these rights are largely exercised by managing the data on your own device (for example, by deleting the App or clearing its local storage). If you have questions or requests, please contact us using the information in Section 13.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the effective date at the top of this page. For material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify users through an App update or an in-app notice. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the App's privacy practices, please contact:</p>
